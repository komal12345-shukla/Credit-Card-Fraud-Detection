# Credit-Card-Fraud-Detection
Analysis Objective The loan providing companies find it hard to give loans to the people due to their insufficient or nonexistent credit history. Because of that, some consumers use it as their advantage by becoming a defaulter. When the company receives a loan application, the company has to decide for loan approval based on the applicant’s profile. Two types of risks are associated with the bank’s decision: • If the applicant is likely to repay the loan, then not approving the loan results in a loss of business to the company. • If the applicant is not likely to repay the loan, i.e. he/she is likely to default, then approving the loan may lead to a financial loss for the company. The data given in this case study contains the information about the loan application at the time of applying for the loan. It contains two types of scenarios: • Target 1: The client with payment difficulties. • Target 0: All other cases when the payment is paid on time. In this case study, we will use EDA to understand how consumer attributes and loan attributes influence the tendency of default.
